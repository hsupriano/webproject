        <p class="about">Hi, my name is Heidi Supriano. I am the mother of 5 beautiful children
        ages ranging from 18 to 2 years. One of my favorite hobbies is
        online gaming. For the past 13 years I have loved gaming, my favorite
        are MMOs, particularly an old game called Star Wars Galaxies. I currently
        volunteer as a CSR on an emulator server for Star Wars Galaxies, and hope
        to one day be able to help develop the game further. Years ago my oldest
        brother told me I should learn to code, he is a self-taught
        developer and thought I would enjoy it and be good at it. Wish I would have
        listened to him back then! I recently decided to look into taking his advice
        and (as much as I hate to admit it) he was right. I aboslutely love coding!
        Everytime I figure something new out I get so excited and can't wait to try
        the next thing. I think web development is the best place for me to start
        out on my programming journey but would eventually like to learn to
        develop games as it is a passion of mine. </p>
