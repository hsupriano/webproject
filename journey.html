    <h1 class="journey">My Journey</h1>
        <p class="journeytext">Why did I decide to learn to code after years of ignoring my brothers
        advice? Well there were a couple different reasons. One is that my family
        has been living off of one income for years, and with 4 children in our
        house that keeps finances very tight. The other was me coming across a
        webinar on Facebook, it was introducing a beginners course for Python. I
        watched the webinar and got really excited. What the guy was talking about
        seemed so interested, so I ended up signing up for the course. I flew through
        the course in about half the average time and was very excited. However
        it was only a piece of the puzzle and I got frustrated because it didn't
        really show what to do next. From there I spent a lot of time watching videos
        trying out free coding sites, reading articles, talking to people, and just
        really trying to figure out what it was I should do next. I soon learned
        that I really first needed to decide what it is I wanted to focus on. Did
        I want to learn front-end web development, back-end web development, software
        development, or one of the other numerous types of development. In the end
        I decided to go with what made the most sense to start adding another income
        for my family the quickest, front-end web development. I have had what I
        like to call a bit of "Dory syndrome" trying to decide on what to learn
        and how to learn it. For every new language or learning method I saw my brain
        says "Oooh that seems interesting" and down a rabbit hole I go. Below are
        just a few of the rabbit holes I have wandered down.</p>
